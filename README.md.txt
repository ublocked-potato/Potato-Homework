## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
- **Issue**: CORS proxy blocked
- **Fix**: The app will auto-switch to next proxy. If all fail, try different search engine.

### Sites Won't Load in Proxy
- **Issue**: Site blocks iframes or CORS
- **Fix**: Go to Settings → Change bypass method or proxy homepage

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### What This Tool Does NOT Do:
- ❌ Store search history
- ❌ Track user data
- ❌ Send data to third parties
- ❌ Use cookies or analytics

### What It DOES:
- ✅ Client-side only processing
- ✅ All data stored in browser localStorage
- ✅ No server-side logs
- ✅ Privacy-first search engines

## 📊 2026 Network Bypass Landscape

Based on current (2026) network security trends:

**Still Works:**
- ✅ CORS proxies (like AllOrigins) - Legitimate services, hard to block
- ✅ Encrypted search proxies (Startpage) - End-to-end encryption
- ✅ GitHub Pages hosting - Educational platform, rarely blocked
- ✅ Protocol switching - Simple but effective

**Getting Harder:**
- ⚠️ Simple iframe embedding - Easily detected
- ⚠️ Direct proxy tools - DPI can identify patterns
- ⚠️ VPN-less solutions - Advanced DPI improving

**Best Practices:**
- Use Startpage for encrypted Google results
- Rotate between multiple CORS proxies
- Combine with VPN for maximum privacy
- Access during off-peak hours for better success

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This tool is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate:
- Client-side web scraping
- CORS bypass techniques
- Privacy-preserving search methods
- Modern web application architecture

**Use responsibly and in accordance with your network's acceptable use policies.**
